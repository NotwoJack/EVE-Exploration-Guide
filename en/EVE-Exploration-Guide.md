# 1 Reading Guide

There are many contents in this guide. Reading from the basic introduction to the "advanced" cosmic signatures will need more than 3 hours and also some ingame practices. Reading this guide repeatedly is suggested.

All contents are based on Tranquility client and English names are used for accuracy. Use Ctrl + F for searching the contents you need.

The guide contains basic and advanced parts. A new player needs only a few days and low SP for basic exploration. For the advanced parts, about one and a half months and more than 2.5m SP would be needed.

If you are a new player, please finish the Career Paths for learning the EVE gaming mechanics (referred to the other guides) before you read the following contents.

# 2 Introduction

Newbie wanna try some exploration after the official newbie tutorial but don’t know how? Veteran but already bored with ratting or pvp? This guide contains detailed introductions of the exploration and some lore about it. Moreover, it also contains many detailed guides about different specific sites, which enable you to initiate quickly into the exploration.

Fly between systems, fight with the pirates of the whole universe, experience the fun of hacking, research unique exploration tips, kill the guy trying to steal your loot. This is our exploratory life. In the ingame channel “南北派专家组” we welcome everyone. Our slogan is ‘Hack the universe!’.

We are neutral and do not have any ingame organization. Our only purpose is to help new players integrate better and faster into the game.

# 3 Quick Guide

**Early stage**
 
1.	The suggestion is to buy one-month omega because all kinds of cloaking devices need omega. If you do not have omega, you do not have to pay but need to know how to make some safe bookmarks and escape when you have dcanned combat probes in 4AU.

2.	If you didn't train any skills in the category “Scanning”, the suggestion is \(buying one Large Skill Injector, but only if possible) training all 7 skills in this category to III, and also another skill to III——\[Empire Faction] Frigate.

3.	Buy an \[Empire Faction] Frigate (Suggestion: Heron) and fit it with [the recommended fit——Heron, Newbie exploration](Heron配置链接). Now you should have 75+ probe strength and you can begin exploring!

**Terminal stage**
    
4.	Finish training the following skills in the particular order:
The skills as which the equipment in [Steel Plates Astero](钢板小白配置链接) needs
Cloaking IV for Covert Ops Cloaking Device II
Astrometrics IV
Hacking V for T2 analyzer
Archaeology V for T2 analyzer
\(about four Large Skill Injectors in total)

5.	Explore with Astero. If you still can not use Covert Ops Cloaking Device II, Astero is not suggested. You can try advanced signatures with Heron first. When you can use T2 Analyzers, the success probability in the hacking minigame would be much higher than before.

6.	Train Cybernetics to V for the Implant Neural Lace 'Blackglass' Net Intrusion 920-40 and some basic skills in category "Engineering" \(important). Later, finish training Astrometrics to V.

7.	Now, most skills needed for exploration have been already trained. Exploring later with other ships \(e.g. Covert Ops, Stratios or Tengu) could be considered. You shall plan on exploring in your own way now.

# 4 Basic Exploration

## 4.1 Probing

First, about the setup of the UI interface:

![logo](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/images/2/2b/Probe_window.png ':size=WIDTHxHEIGHT')

1.	Press Alt+P to open the window above.
2.	Click “Dock” at top-right to anchor this window to the interface.
3.	Tick "Cosmic signal" in "Filtered".
4.	Get familiar with the icons and buttons on the interface, and complete the layout.

Let’s start scanning, here are some useful tips:

1.	Use Pinpoint formations \(the first one).
2.	Click once the red-dot on the Solar System Map or click once the signal on "Probe scanner" would move the mid-point to there.
3.	Double-click on the Solar System Map for changing the view between vertical and horizontal.
4.	Use 8AU probe size at first. If your probe strength is above 80 and the signal is above 20%, then you could use 2AU size the second time. For newbies, first 8AU and then reduce the size one by one is suggested \(8AU-4AU-2AU-1AU-0.25AU).
5.	When the signature on the Solar System Map is a sphere or a disk, adjust the scan area so that the sphere or disk is completely enwrapped.
6.	When the signature shows connected two dots, watch how much the signal has risen. If it has risen a lot, it means the close dot is the right one. If not, then the far dot is the right one \(the far one in most cases).
7.	When the signal could not be analyzed to 100% even with 0.25AU probe size, try to hold Ctrl and spin the mouse wheel to gather the probes to "almost a ball" \(⚠: only "almost"). Then try once again. If the signal is still not 100%, it is mostly caused by poor probe strength.
8.	Create a fleet.![logo](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/images/e/e3/Fleet.png )Then you can use the numbers on the keyboard for marking the containers, which could increase the efficiency.
9.	Once the signal is above 25%, the type and level of the signal would be shown \(e.g. combat site, gas site, data site or relic site). Once above 75%, the name would be shown. At 100%, warping to there would be enabled.
10.	Gas volume and color could only be shown with Shader Quality equal or above “Medium” in Graphic Content Settings. In potato mode, Gas volume and color are transparent. Remind this before you run any Sleeper Sites.

### 4.3.1 Wormhole

The following text is a brief introduction about the Wormholes. For a more detailed introduction pls read [Uniwiki](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Wormholes).

A Wormhole can be simply regarded as an unstable stargate to a Wormhole Space or a system elsewhere. In the C1-C3 Wormhole Spaces, the pirate Relic and Data Sites could appear, and the numbers of them are more than in Highsec&Lowsec&Nullsec. The Sleeper Sites in wormhole spaces are not suggested for exploration. There are strong NPC ships inside and you could lose your ship there really quickly. The Local channel in WH does not show the capsuleers inside. This means you will have to keep using Dscan for scout and always be ready for an escape.

When you are near enough to a wormhole, then it would be shown on the overview and you can read it's name. If it is called K162\(缺少K162图片)then this wormhole was "opened" from the opposite. 

To identify a Shattered Wormhole Space, confirm if all planets inside the system are shattered. In principle, all kinds of cosmic signatures could appear in a Shattered Wormhole Space.

Every time you have entered a wormhole, save your location \(shortcut: Ctrl+B) immediately. If there are many structures in a WH Space, it could mean that some players are living there, and staying there for a long time is not suggested. If there are only less than five cosmic signatures, then there is a good chance that someone just came here before and explored this wormhole system.

A website for inquiring the information about the wormholes: http://anoik.is
Enter the name\(缺少虫洞名称图片)of the WH Space and you can get the info.

Or compare the description of the wormhole with the following tables for basic information.

**--To where--**

|In description   |To      |
|-----------------|--------|
|Unknown          |C1/C2/C3|
|Dangerous Unknown|C4/C5   |
|Deadly Unknown   |C6      |
|High Security    |Highsec |
|Low Security     |Lowsec  |
|Null Security    |Nullsec |

**--The time left--**

|In description      |Time left|
|--------------------|---------|

|beginning to decay  |4h ~ 24h |
|reaching the end    |5min ~ 4h|
|verge of dissipating|< 5min   |

**--Mass--**

|verge of collapse|< 10%    |

### 4.3.2 Drone Regions

The Drone Regions are on the top right of the Map \([Map in Appendix](对应链接)) and consist of the following 8 regions:<br>
Cobalt Edge<br>
Etherium Reach<br>
Malpais<br>
Oasa<br>
Outer Passage<br>
Perrigen Falls<br>
The Kalevala Expanse<br>
The Spire
 
In these regions, the Drone Data Sites could appear. The loot contains Rogue Drone Components, Integrated and Augmented Drone BPCs. A successful hack \(including hacking empty containers) may trigger an expedition, which is a new Drone Data Site.

In the Drone Regions, there are no Relic Sites and all Ghost Sites appear as Level I Combat Sites.

## 4.4 Hacking

![logo](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/images/8/80/Hacking_Indications.png ':size=WIDTHxHEIGHT')

The image above is from a hacking minigame. Coherence is your HP and Strength is your Attack. Based on the fit [Heron, Newbie exploration](对应链接) from the chapter 3 Quick Guide, there should be 70 Coherence and 25 Strength. Except those most difficult hacking minigames with red System Core, the other minigames should be relatively easy now.

Every node will display a number from 1-5 when you click it. This number means the distance to the nearest safe node \(a Utility Subsystem, Data Cache, or System Core). When the distance is above 5 the node will still display 5. If a node in a corner displays 5 then you shall change the direction, because there are no useful nodes nearby. When your Strength is low, the route along the edge is suggested. Though a comparatively longer time is needed for hacking in this case, but you could find another way easily and won’t be stuck somewhere. When your Strength is high, choosing the midpoints of the hexagons on the way is suggested, because the safe nodes could be detected easier.

**Hacking strategy:** There is a high possibility that the System Core appears at the opposite angle, so two strategies are recommended. The first one is going straight \(diagonal) to the opposite angle like the red line in the image below. It needs a high Strength and you can use this strategy immediately after you have confirmed the difficulty of the minigame. The second one is going along the edge like the green line. This strategy is suitable for the normal sites without the time limit. If a Defensive Subsystem appears, it is not necessary to disable it immediately, because you could change a direction and continue hacking. This strategy has also another advantage when the System Core is not at the opposite angle but at one of the two angles near the start point. When you get a Self Repair, use it ASAP because there is no limit for Coherence. The other Utility Subsystems shall be kept and used according to the table below.

Because of the delay, it could happen that you click accidentally once more and find a Defensive Subsystem near the System Core. So when you are hacking, do not be nervous or click the nodes too fast. When your Coherence is too low for the System Core, do not forget searching in other nodes for the Utility Subsystems. The best way of increasing the success possibility is improving the Strength. 60 Strength could be achieved with T2 Analyzers and Neural Lace 'Blackglass' Net Intrusion 920-40. So the skills for the T2 Data Analyzer shall be trained ASAP.

![logo](https://notwojack.github.io/EVE-Exploration-Guide/image/4.4-1.png ':size=WIDTHxHEIGHT')

**The Rule of Six**
- If a node is adjacent to other six nodes \(which build a complete hexagon), then this node is safe.
- When it is not safe, then the System Core must be in one of the six adjacent nodes.

Using this rule could decently increase hacking efficiency. The midpoints of the hexagons are safe. If not, then the System Core is within easy reach. Before a newbie going to explore his/her first Sleeper Cache, it is highly suggested to understand this rule first.

|**Defensive Subsystem**|                                                                                                |        |

# 5 Equipment

The equipment here is about the exploration. The most important factors which affect the exploration are the scanner strength and the Attack. Of course, the equipment for the escape is also important. With a Mobile Depot, the equipment on the ship could be changed anywhere at any time. This can make up the lack of skill points.

## 5.2 High Power Slot

Recommended for newbies: SOE probes+T1 Core Probe Launcher, cheap but effective. For cloaking, a T2 cloaking device is recommended. An Astero should always be fitted with the Covert Ops cloaking Device II.

## 5.4 Low Power Slot

For newbies, higher agility is suggested. With two Inertial Stabilizers and one Nanofiber Internal Structure, the align time could be reduced to less than 4s. If there is still a lowslot left, a Sensor Booster is a good option for a further targeting range, which could increase the efficiency. The Warp Core Stabilizers could be refitted for travel.

## 5.5 Rigs

Normally, newbies don’t have enough Scan Strength, so two or more T1 Gravity Capacitor Upgrades shall be fitted. After enough skills have been trained, those Gravity Capacitor Upgrades could be changed into Signal Focusing Kit or Low Friction Nozzle Joints or any other rigs (e.g. Hyperspatial Velocity Optimizer).
<br>T2 Rigs need normally more Calibration, so simulate first before fitting the Rigs.
