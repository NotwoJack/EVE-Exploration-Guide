# 1 Reading Guide

There are many contents in this guide. Reading from the basic introduction to the "advanced" cosmic signatures will need more than 3 hours and also some ingame practices. Reading this guide repeatedly is suggested.

All contents are based on Tranquility client and English names are used for accuracy. Use Ctrl + F for searching the contents you need.

The guide contains basic and advanced parts. A new player needs only a few days and low SP for basic exploration. For the advanced parts, about one and a half months and more than 2.5m SP would be needed.

If you are a new player, please finish the Career Paths for learning the EVE gaming mechanics \(referred to the other guides) before you read the following contents.

# 2 Introduction

Newbie wanna try some exploration after the official newbie tutorial but don’t know how? Veteran but already bored with ratting or pvp? This guide contains detailed introductions of the exploration and some lore about it. Moreover, it also contains many detailed guides about different specific sites, which enable you to initiate quickly into the exploration.

Fly between systems, fight with the pirates of the whole universe, experience the fun of hacking, research unique exploration tips, kill the guy trying to steal your loot. This is our exploratory life. In the ingame channel “南北派专家组” we welcome everyone. Our slogan is ‘Hack the universe!’.

# 3 Quick Guide

**Early stage**
 
1.	The suggestion is to buy one-month omega because all kinds of cloaking devices need omega. If you do not have omega, you do not have to pay but need to know how to make some safe bookmarks and escape when you have dcanned combat probes in 4AU.

2.	If you didn't train any skills in the category “Scanning”, the suggestion is \(buying one Large Skill Injector, but only if possible) training all 7 skills in this category to III, and also another skill to III——\[Empire Faction] Frigate.

3.	Buy an \[Empire Faction] Frigate \(Suggestion: Heron) and fit it with [the recommended fit——Heron, Newbie exploration](Heron配置链接). Now you should have 75+ probe strength and you can begin exploring.

**Terminal stage**
    
4.	Finish training the following skills in the particular order:
The skills as which the equipment in [Steel Plates Astero](钢板小白配置链接) needs
Cloaking IV for Covert Ops Cloaking Device II
Astrometrics IV
Hacking V for T2 analyzer
Archaeology V for T2 analyzer
\(about four Large Skill Injectors in total)

5.	Explore with Astero. If you still can not use Covert Ops Cloaking Device II, Astero is not suggested. You can try advanced signatures with Heron first. When you can use T2 Analyzers, the success probability in the hacking minigame would be much higher than before.

6.	Train Cybernetics to V for the Implant Neural Lace 'Blackglass' Net Intrusion 920-40 and some basic skills in category "Engineering" \(important). Later, finish training Astrometrics to V.

7.	Now, most skills needed for exploration have been already trained. Exploring later with other ships \(e.g. Covert Ops, Stratios or Tengu) could be considered. You shall plan on exploring in your own way now.

# 4 Basic Exploration

## 4.1 Probing

First, about the setup of the UI interface:

![logo](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/images/2/2b/Probe_window.png ':size=WIDTHxHEIGHT')

1.	Press Alt+P to open the window above.
2.	Click “Dock” at top-right to anchor this window to the interface.
3.	Tick "Cosmic signal" in "Filtered".
4.	Get familiar with the icons and buttons on the interface, and complete the layout.

Let’s start scanning, here are some useful tips:

1.	Use Pinpoint formations \(the first one).
2.	Click once the red-dot on the Solar System Map or click once the signal on "Probe scanner" would move the mid-point to there.
3.	Double-click on the Solar System Map for changing the view between vertical and horizontal.
4.	Use 8AU probe size at first. If your probe strength is above 80 and the signal is above 20%, then you could use 2AU size the second time. For newbies, first 8AU and then reduce the size one by one is suggested \(8AU-4AU-2AU-1AU-0.25AU).
5.	When the signature on the Solar System Map is a sphere or a disk, adjust the scan area so that the sphere or disk is completely enwrapped.
6.	When the signature shows connected two dots, watch how much the signal has risen. If it has risen a lot, it means the close dot is the right one. If not, then the far dot is the right one \(the far one in most cases).
7.	When the signal could not be analyzed to 100% even with 0.25AU probe size, try to hold Ctrl and spin the mouse wheel to gather the probes to "almost a ball" \(⚠: only "almost"). Then try once again. If the signal is still not 100%, it is mostly caused by poor probe strength.
8.	Create a fleet.![logo](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/images/e/e3/Fleet.png )Then you can use the numbers on the keyboard for marking the containers, which could increase the efficiency.
9.	Once the signal is above 25%, the type and level of the signal would be shown \(e.g. combat site, gas site, data site or relic site). Once above 75%, the name would be shown. At 100%, warping to there would be enabled.
10.	Gas volume and color could only be shown with Shader Quality equal or above “Medium” in Graphic Content Settings. In potato mode, Gas volume and color are transparent. Remind this before you run any Sleeper Sites.

### 4.3.1 Wormhole

The following text is a brief introduction about the Wormholes. For a more detailed introduction pls read [Uniwiki](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Wormholes).

A Wormhole can be simply regarded as an unstable stargate to a Wormhole Space or a system elsewhere. In the C1-C3 Wormhole Spaces, the pirate Relic and Data Sites could appear, and the numbers of them are more than in Highsec&Lowsec&Nullsec. The Sleeper Sites in wormhole spaces are not suggested for exploration. There are strong NPC ships inside and you could lose your ship there really quickly. The Local channel in WH does not show the capsuleers inside. This means you will have to keep using Dscan for scout and always be ready for an escape.

When you are near enough to a wormhole, then it would be shown on the overview and you can read it's name. If it is called K162\(缺少K162图片)then this wormhole was "opened" from the opposite. 

To identify a Shattered Wormhole Space, confirm if all planets inside the system are shattered. In principle, all kinds of cosmic signatures could appear in a Shattered Wormhole Space.

Every time you have entered a wormhole, save your location \(shortcut: Ctrl+B) immediately. If there are many structures in a WH Space, it could mean that some players are living there, and staying there for a long time is not suggested. If there are only less than five cosmic signatures, then there is a good chance that someone just came here before and explored this wormhole system.

A website for inquiring the information about the wormholes: http://anoik.is
Enter the name\(缺少虫洞名称图片)of the WH Space and you can get the info.

Or compare the description of the wormhole with the following tables for basic information.

**--To where--**

|In description   |To      |
|-----------------|--------|
|Unknown          |C1/C2/C3|
|Dangerous Unknown|C4/C5   |
|Deadly Unknown   |C6      |
|High Security    |Highsec |
|Low Security     |Lowsec  |
|Null Security    |Nullsec |

**--The time left--**

|In description      |Time left|
|--------------------|---------|

|beginning to decay  |4h ~ 24h |
|reaching the end    |5min ~ 4h|
|verge of dissipating|< 5min   |

**--Mass--**

|verge of collapse|< 10%    |

### 4.3.2 Drone Regions

The Drone Regions are on the top right of the Map \([Map in Appendix](对应链接)) and consist of the following 8 regions:<br>
Cobalt Edge<br>
Etherium Reach<br>
Malpais<br>
Oasa<br>
Outer Passage<br>
Perrigen Falls<br>
The Kalevala Expanse<br>
The Spire
 
In these regions, the Drone Data Sites could appear. The loot contains Rogue Drone Components, Integrated and Augmented Drone BPCs. A successful hack \(including hacking empty containers) may trigger an expedition, which is a new Drone Data Site.

In the Drone Regions, there are no Relic Sites and all Ghost Sites appear as Level I Combat Sites.

## 4.4 Hacking

![logo](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/images/8/80/Hacking_Indications.png ':size=WIDTHxHEIGHT')

The image above is from a hacking minigame. Coherence is your HP and Strength is your Attack. Based on the fit [Heron, Newbie exploration](对应链接) from the chapter 3 Quick Guide, there should be 70 Coherence and 25 Strength. Except those most difficult hacking minigames with red System Core, the other minigames should be relatively easy now.

Every node will display a number from 1 to 5 when you click it. This number means the distance to the nearest safe node \(a Utility Subsystem, Data Cache, or System Core). When the distance is above 5 the node will still display 5. If a node in a corner displays 5 then you shall change the direction, because there are no useful nodes nearby. When your Strength is low, the route along the edge is suggested. Though a comparatively longer time is needed for hacking in this case, but you could find another way easily and won’t be stuck somewhere. When your Strength is high, choosing the midpoints of the hexagons on the way is suggested, because the safe nodes could be detected easier.

**Hacking strategy:** There is a high possibility that the System Core appears at the opposite angle, so two strategies are recommended. The first one is going straight \(diagonal) to the opposite angle like the red line in the image below. It needs a high Strength and you can use this strategy immediately after you have confirmed the difficulty of the minigame. The second one is going along the edge like the green line. This strategy is suitable for the normal sites without the time limit. If a Defensive Subsystem appears, it is not necessary to disable it immediately, because you could change a direction and continue hacking. This strategy has also another advantage when the System Core is not at the opposite angle but at one of the two angles near the start point. When you get a Self Repair, use it ASAP because there is no limit for Coherence. The other Utility Subsystems shall be kept and used according to the table below.

Because of the delay, it could happen that you click accidentally once more and find a Defensive Subsystem near the System Core. So when you are hacking, do not be nervous or click the nodes too fast. When your Coherence is too low for the System Core, do not forget searching in other nodes for the Utility Subsystems. The best way of increasing the success possibility is improving the Strength. 60 Strength could be achieved with T2 Analyzers and Neural Lace 'Blackglass' Net Intrusion 920-40. So the skills for the T2 Data Analyzer shall be trained ASAP.

![logo](https://notwojack.github.io/EVE-Exploration-Guide/image/4.4-1.png ':size=WIDTHxHEIGHT')

**The Rule of Six**
- If a node is adjacent to other six nodes \(which build a complete hexagon), then this node is safe.
- When it is not safe, then the System Core must be in one of the six adjacent nodes.

Using this rule could decently increase hacking efficiency. The midpoints of the hexagons are safe. If not, then the System Core is within easy reach. Before a newbie going to explore his/her first Sleeper Cache, it is highly suggested to understand this rule first.

|**Defensive Subsystem**|                                                                                                |        |

# 5 Equipment

The equipment here is about the exploration. The most important factors which affect the exploration are the scanner strength and the Attack. Of course, the equipment for the escape is also important. With a Mobile Depot, the equipment on the ship could be changed anywhere at any time. This can make up the lack of skill points.

## 5.2 High Slot

Recommended for newbies: SOE probes+T1 Core Probe Launcher, cheap but effective. For cloaking, a T2 cloaking device is recommended. An Astero should always be fitted with the Covert Ops cloaking Device II.

## 5.4 Low Slot

For newbies, higher agility is suggested. With two Inertial Stabilizers and one Nanofiber Internal Structure, the align time could be reduced to less than 4s. If there is still a lowslot left, a Sensor Booster is a good option for a further targeting range, which could increase the efficiency. The Warp Core Stabilizers could be refitted for travel.

## 5.5 Rigs

Normally, newbies don’t have enough Scan Strength, so two or more T1 Gravity Capacitor Upgrades shall be fitted. After enough skills have been trained, those Gravity Capacitor Upgrades could be changed into Signal Focusing Kit or Low Friction Nozzle Joints or any other Rigs (e.g. Hyperspatial Velocity Optimizer).
<br>T2 Rigs need normally more Calibration, so simulate first before fitting the Rigs.

\(Left: MOTD Right: Overview)

2.	Set the default orbit distance to 2100m: Click any entity and right-click the orbit icon \(on the Selected Item window). Now you could set default orbit distance. 
<br>PS: Orbiting at the default orbit distance is only possible by giving the orbit command by the Selected Item window or the Radial Menu, but not by the Context Menu.

## 6.2 Tips & Tricks

**Cloak trick by 784 fvtr**

![logo](https://notwojack.github.io/EVE-Exploration-Guide/image/6.2-1.png)

After jumping through a stargate, double-click anywhere in space \(e.g. arrow 1). Pay attention to the cloak icon in the top left corner if it disappears \(the arrow 2). Once the cloak icon has disappeared, Cloaking Device shall be activated immediately \(e.g. arrow 3) and then activate the MWD \(e.g. arrow 4). When the process above is completed, double-click elsewhere in space.
<br>\(70% of the current max speed and the aligning are the requirements for entering warp. The right time point for warping shall be decided by your own intuition.)

Advance

1.	There are three kinds of cloak tricks. The first one is the text above and it is the basic one.
2.	The second kind of cloak trick is similar to the first one. The nuance is, that MWD is first activated and then the cloaking device.
3.	The third kind of cloak trick. First align to a moon, then activate MWD, after that activate the cloaking device. Wait until the MWD circle is about at 3/4, then decloak and warp to 0m of the moon.
4.	Any object within 2000m will prevent ships from cloaking and cause cloaked ships to decloak.
5.	The first and second kinds of cloak tricks could be used for gate camp in Nullsec \(e.g. case 1). The first one shall be chosen when the internet connection is not good. Otherwise, the second one shall be chosen. The third one could be used in a case without any bubble \(e.g. case 2).
6.	In case 1, after completing the cloak trick successfully, decloaking is not suggested when the hostile ships are not leaving. You shall leave the bubble first and have at least 45km+ distance to the hostile ships, then align first, and at the end decloak and warp away.

**How to use D-scan**

Clicking this icon![logo](https://notwojack.github.io/EVE-Exploration-Guide/image/6.2-2.png ':size=WIDTHxHEIGHT')on the D-scan window<br>could show the current D-scan area. Clicking the default shortcut D could scan and show all uncloaked objects in the range. The approximate location of the hostiles could be found out by d-scanning repeatedly with different angles and ranges.

**Safe spots / Deep safes**

![logo](https://notwojack.github.io/EVE-Exploration-Guide/image/6.2-4.png ':size=WIDTHxHEIGHT')

Warp to a planet, save the location with Ctrl+B while warping \(e.g. the red dot).
PS: The location of the saved bookmark is determined when "Submit" is clicked, so get ready beforehand.
The safe spots got by the method above are mostly near the center of the system, so they are probably still in the enemy Dscan range. A deep space spot would be safer. When you find a site or wormhole on the outside of the system, it could be a good deep space spot and shall be saved. In the terminal stage you should have at least one deep space spot per system in the area where you explore often.
Tactical bookmarks near the stargates are also necessary, especially for the systems, where the distance between the stargates are >14.3AU. In such a system you can not dscan immediately the enemies camping at another stargate after jumping. A tactical bookmark 150km+ away from the stargate is suggested.

## 6.3 Escape

The operations in the following three cases are all based on T1 frig with a Cloaking Device. It would be easier for Astero. <p>
Before entering the dangerous zones, you could first store the things with high value in an NPC station. In Personal Assets in Neocom you could find where these things are.

**Before jumping**

When you worry about a bubble or someone waiting at the gate, you should first warp to somewhere in 14.3AU from the gate, so that you could dscan the gate. If there is any bubble or many ships there \(>5), trying to warp to there for approaching the gate and jumping is not suggested. If there are only a few ships \(1-2), trying to jump is worth.

**After jumping**

Don’t be nervous if you are in a bubble. Now you are cloaked for 60s. Switch to the tactical camera and find out where are the ships and where is open. Align \(double click) to where is open and activate the MWD and cloaking device at the same time \(hotkeys are better than the mouse). Hopefully, you get out of the bubble after the only cycle of MWD. Now you can jump, or wait for a while and watch what the hostile ships are going to do.
Or you don’t try to warp, but approach the gate (overload and activate the MWD).
If there are only a few ships, you could use [the third operation of the cloak trick](对应链接).
If there is any Interdictor, the method is the same as above.

**In the system**

Check the local before exploring. If there is someone else in the local, dscan the sites first. If only dscan cannot judge the danger, you could warp first to 70km and explore, after confirming that nobody is waiting there. Check the local all the time when you are exploring \(switch to PVP/警戒, adjust the UI of the Overview so that you can check it all the time. Dscan every 15s. If the align time of your ship is lower than 4s, you don’t have to dscan, but you still need to check the overview.) If any ship shows up, warp immediately to your safe spot and cloak.

**Reacted too slowly**

When the hostile is already in 30km and is locking you, align to the opposite and cloak immediately \(make sure nothing is in 2km). Now use [the third operation of the cloak trick](对应链接), activate the MWD and the cloaking device at the same time \(the enemy will lose you). But you need to align and be ready for warping before the 3/4 of the only cycle of MWD.

**Worst case**

When the hostile is already on you \(in 2km) and you can even not make the cloak trick. Overload the MWD and align to the opposite. Try to activate the Cloaking Device. If you make it, operate the same as above. If you are locked and tackled by disruptor and webbed, you still stand a chance of holding the damage and getting out of the range. Warp immediately when it is possible.
If you are tackled by scrambler, engage the hostile with your ECM drones and hope they will work. Don’t give up trying to warp. At least you can save your pod.

**Introduction of the equipment**  

![logo](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/images/3/35/Icon_warp_disruptor_i.png ':size=WIDTHxHEIGHT')
**Warp Disruptor:** The warpcore disabling strength for the disruptors is 1 point. Disruptors can prevent you from warping but cannot shut down your MWD. T2 Disruptor has 24km basic range \(overloaded 28km). It’s not hard to escape while being tackled by it. Overload the MWD, align to the opposite, and warp immediately when it’s possible. 

![logo](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/images/b/b3/Icon_warp_scrambler_i.png ':size=WIDTHxHEIGHT')
**Warp Scrambler:** The warpcore disabling strength for the scramblers is 2 points \(faction modules have 3 points). Scramblers can prevent warping and shut down the MWD. T2 Scrambler has 9km basic range \(overloaded 10.8km). For an Astero with MWD, being scrambled means normally a new KM.
However, if your ship has Warp Core Stabilizers \(normally 2-3, at least 2), warping being tackled is possible, but only when your warp core strengths are more than disabling strengths. The Stabilizer decreases a lot of lock range, which decreases your efficiency of exploration. And it cannot protect the MWD from the Scrambler.

![logo](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/images/2/27/Icon_stasis_webifier_i.png ':size=WIDTHxHEIGHT')
**Stasis Webifier:** The T2 version decreases 60% of the max speed \(10km range, 13km when overheated). Normally, an Astero has only less than 200m/s speed when it’s webbed and scrambled.
Normally a Sabre would use 200mm/220mm/280mm Projectile Turrets. So try to hang on in their optimal range and run away from them, but it is hard to survive if you have already been tackled. Your ship is possibly destroyed after two cycles of their turrets. However, if you have ECM drones, the possibility of surviving is bigger though it is hard to ECM a ship with ECM drones.

# 7 Advance

All the following operations are based on the fit [T2 Steel Plates Astero](对应链接) in the Appendix. The valuable things could be stored in a Mobile Depot before the exploration in the advanced sites. Remember to save the location of the wreck after a loss, so that some valuable things could still be looted back. If you are using Stratios or T3C, refer to the data below and other ways could be found. For the main loot pls read [Loot](对应链接). Sell those blue loots from the Sleeper Caches to the NPC. In the ingame market, the nearest NPC order could be found. Sell them at best on the way home directly.

## 7.1 Ghost Sites

There are 4 kinds of ghost sites, all of them are level III Data Sites. Expect in the eight drone regions, they are level I Combat Sites. The superior Ghost Site only exists in WH space.
Lesser/Standard/Improved/Superior + Faction + Covert Research Facility
There are four cans in total and are arranged as a square or a half-circle. There is a hidden timer from 60 to 240s \(time is random), which starts when “warp” is clicked. The timer will not start if you warp cloaked, but the recalibration for locking lasts at least 5s. So you should estimate the time and decloak before landing..
When the timer ends, the NPC ships will warp into the site and tackle you absolutely. When the background music becomes hurried, the timer left is less than 30s. In the hacking minigame, there is no background music. In the improved and superior ghost sites, there are no background music changes as the cue.
The can will explode and cause explosion damage when it gets any damage or the first hacking fails. In more difficult Ghost Sites, the cans also cause higher damage. For tanking the can explosion, high explosion resistance and enough EHP are needed. Except for the cans in superior, the others don’t have hard hacking minigames \(basically with green/yellow system core). A T2 data analyzer is suggested. The Ghost Sites are dangerous so the newbies shall use a cheap hull and fit \(e.g. Heron) and store the expensive stuff somewhere safe \(e.g. in the Mobile Depot).

Attention: Warp while hacking a can is counted as the hacking is failed and then triggers the explosion of the can you were hacking. Do not orbit while your propulsion module is on, because the ship could fly out of the range of the analyzer \(6000m) and the hacking is also failed.

1.	Put everything else into the Mobile Depot \(included the SOE launcher)\(and refit the low slot with three armor explosive hardeners and one 200mm Steel Plates).
2.	Warp cloaked, decloak when the cans appear on the overview so that they could be locked immediately on contact \(Without Covert Ops Cloaking Device: warp first to the nearest location to the ghost site, align to it and then warp)
3.	Find out the can with a different name from four and approach it first \(don’t need to orbit, keep distance 2100m). Turn on the propulsion module for one cycle.
4.	While you are approaching, turn on the three explosive hardeners, lock all cans, scan them with cargo scanners and confirm the most valuable one. Pls first remember the [valuable loots](对应链接) in the ghost sites.
5.	After the hacking, listen to the background music, once it becomes hurried then leave immediately. The Astero with explosive hardener can ignore this music until the NPC ships appear on the overview.
6.	Once the NPC ships appear, the explosive hardener Astero must cloak and leave immediately. A ship with high EHP like Stratios could leave after finishing the current can.

You have about 8s to warp out after the rats have shown on the Overview. Generally, the box will explode after 15s rats landed, and rats will warp out after 30s they landed.

Tips：
1.	An Astero refitted with 3x Explosive Armor Hardener II in low slot will be able to tank once can explosion from an Improved Ghost Site. When rats show up on the grid, cloak first and then warp out. 
2.	You could launch a drone. The NPC ships would first fire on the drone so that you could have a little bit more time.
3.	You could warp to within 10km and would be nearer to a can.

Can explosion damage formula：
Real damage = Can explosion damage X \(1 - explosion resistance)
Exp.：A can in Improved explodes and the ship is an Astero with 88% explosion resistance from armor
Received damage = 10000 X（1 - 0.88）= 1200
It means if the astero has more than 1200 armor, then it won't be destroyed by the explosion. \(Shield and Structure could also be counted in.)
