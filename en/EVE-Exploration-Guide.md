# 1 Reading Guide

There are many contents in this guide. Reading from the basic introduction to the "advanced" cosmic signatures will need more than 3 hours and also some ingame practices. Reading this guide repeatedly is suggested.

All contents are based on Tranquility client and English names are used for accuracy. Use Ctrl + F for searching the contents you need.

The guide contains basic and advanced parts. A new player needs only a few days and low SP for basic exploration. For the advanced parts, about one and a half months and more than 2.5m SP would be needed.

If you are a new player, please finish the Career Paths for learning the EVE gaming mechanics (referred to the other guides) before you read the following contents.

# 2 Introduction

Newbie wanna try some exploration after the official newbie tutorial but don’t know how? Veteran but already bored with ratting or pvp? This guide contains detailed introductions of the exploration and some lore about it. Moreover, it also contains many detailed guides about different specific sites, which enable you to initiate quickly into the exploration.

Fly between systems, fight with the pirates of the whole universe, experience the fun of hacking, research unique exploration tips, kill the guy trying to steal your loot. This is our exploratory life. In the ingame channel “南北派专家组” we welcome everyone. Our slogan is ‘Hack the universe!’.

We are neutral and do not have any ingame organization. Our only purpose is to help new players integrate better and faster into the game.

# 3 Quick Guide

**Early stage**
 
1.	The suggestion is to buy one-month omega because all kinds of cloaking devices need omega. If you do not have omega, you do not have to pay but need to know how to make some safe bookmarks and escape when you have dcanned combat probes in 4AU.

2.	If you didn't train any skills in the category “Scanning”, the suggestion is (buying one Large Skill Injector, but only if possible) training all 7 skills in this category to III, and also another skill to III——\[Empire Faction] Frigate.

3.	Buy an \[Empire Faction] Frigate (Suggestion: Heron) and fit it with [the recommended fit——Heron, Newbie exploration](Heron配置链接). Now you should have 75+ probe strength and you can begin exploring.

**Terminal stage**
    
4.	Finish training the following skills in the particular order:
The skills as which the equipment in [Steel Plates Astero](钢板小白配置链接) needs
Cloaking IV for Covert Ops Cloaking Device II
Astrometrics IV
Hacking V for T2 analyzer
Archaeology V for T2 analyzer
(about four Large Skill Injectors in total)

5.	Explore with Astero. If you still can not use Covert Ops Cloaking Device II, Astero is not suggested. You can try advanced signatures with Heron first. When you can use T2 Analyzers, the success probability in the hacking minigame would be much higher than before.

6.	Train Cybernetics to V for the Implant Neural Lace 'Blackglass' Net Intrusion 920-40 and some basic skills in category "Engineering" (important). Later, finish training Astrometrics to V.

7.	Now, most skills needed for exploration have been already trained. Exploring later with other ships (e.g. Covert Ops, Stratios or Tengu) could be considered. You shall plan on exploring in your own way now.

# 4 Basic Exploration

## 4.1 Probing

First, about the setup of the UI interface:

![logo](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/images/2/2b/Probe_window.png ':size=WIDTHxHEIGHT')

1.	Press Alt+P to open the window above.
2.	Click “Dock” at top-right to anchor this window to the interface.
3.	Tick "Cosmic signal" in "Filtered".
4.	Get familiar with the icons and buttons on the interface, and complete the layout.

Let’s start scanning, here are some useful tips:

1.	Use Pinpoint formations (the first one).
2.	Click once the red-dot on the Solar System Map or click once the signal on "Probe scanner" would move the mid-point to there.
3.	Double-click on the Solar System Map for changing the view between vertical and horizontal.
4.	Use 8AU probe size at first. If your probe strength is above 80 and the signal is above 20%, then you could use 2AU size the second time. For newbies, first 8AU and then reduce the size one by one is suggested (8AU-4AU-2AU-1AU-0.25AU).
5.	When the signature on the Solar System Map is a sphere or a disk, adjust the scan area so that the sphere or disk is completely enwrapped.
6.	When the signature shows connected two dots, watch how much the signal has risen. If it has risen a lot, it means the close dot is the right one. If not, then the far dot is the right one (the far one in most cases).
7.	When the signal could not be analyzed to 100% even with 0.25AU probe size, try to hold Ctrl and spin the mouse wheel to gather the probes to "almost a ball" (only "almost"). Then try once again. If the signal is still not 100%, it is mostly caused by poor probe strength.
8.	Create a fleet.![logo](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/images/e/e3/Fleet.png )Then you can use the numbers on the keyboard for marking the containers, which could increase the efficiency.
9.	Once the signal is above 25%, the type and level of the signal would be shown (e.g. combat site, gas site, data site or relic site). Once above 75%, the name would be shown. At 100%, warping to there would be enabled.
10.	Gas volume and color could only be shown with Shader Quality equal or above “Medium” in Graphic Content Settings. In potato mode, Gas volume and color are transparent. Remind this before you run any Sleeper Sites.

### 4.3.1 Wormhole

The following text is a brief introduction about the Wormholes. For a more detailed introduction please read [Uniwiki](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Wormholes).

A Wormhole can be simply regarded as an unstable stargate to a Wormhole Space or a system elsewhere. In the C1-C3 Wormhole Spaces, the pirate Relic and Data Sites could appear, and the numbers of them are more than in Highsec&Lowsec&Nullsec. The Sleeper Sites in wormhole spaces are not suggested for exploration. There are strong NPC ships inside and you could lose your ship there really quickly. The Local channel in WH does not show the capsuleers inside. This means you will have to keep using Dscan for scout and always be ready for an escape.

When you are near enough to a wormhole, then it would be shown on the overview and you can read it's name. If it is called K162(缺少K162图片)then this wormhole was "opened" from the opposite. 

To identify a Shattered Wormhole Space, confirm if all planets inside the system are shattered. In principle, all kinds of cosmic signatures could appear in a Shattered Wormhole Space.

Every time you have entered a wormhole, save your location (shortcut: Ctrl+B) immediately. If there are many structures in a WH Space, it could mean that some players are living there, and staying there for a long time is not suggested. If there are only less than five cosmic signatures, then there is a good chance that someone just came here before and explored this wormhole system.

A website for inquiring the information about the wormholes: http://anoik.is
Enter the name(缺少虫洞名称图片)of the WH Space and you can get the info.

Or compare the description of the wormhole with the following tables for basic information.

**--To where--**

|In description   |To      |
|-----------------|--------|
|Unknown          |C1/C2/C3|
|Dangerous Unknown|C4/C5   |
|Deadly Unknown   |C6      |
|High Security    |Highsec |
|Low Security     |Lowsec  |
|Null Security    |Nullsec |

**--The time left--**

|In description      |Time left|
|--------------------|---------|

|verge of collapse|< 10%    |

### 4.3.2 Drone Regions

The Drone Regions are on the top right of the Map ([Map in Appendix](对应链接)) and consist of the following 8 regions:<br>
Cobalt Edge<br>
Etherium Reach<br>
Malpais<br>
Oasa<br>
Outer Passage<br>
Perrigen Falls<br>
The Kalevala Expanse<br>
The Spire
 
In these regions, the Drone Data Sites could appear. The loot contains Rogue Drone Components, Integrated and Augmented Drone BPCs. A successful hack (including hacking empty containers) may trigger an expedition, which is a new Drone Data Site.

In the Drone Regions, there are no Relic Sites and all Ghost Sites appear as Level I Combat Sites.

## 4.4 Hacking

![logo](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/images/8/80/Hacking_Indications.png ':size=WIDTHxHEIGHT')

The image above is from a hacking minigame. Coherence is your HP and Strength is your Attack. Based on the fit [Heron, Newbie exploration](对应链接) from the chapter 3 Quick Guide, there should be 70 Coherence and 25 Strength. Except those most difficult hacking minigames with red System Core, the other minigames should be relatively easy now.

Every node will display a number from 1 to 5 when you click it. This number means the distance to the nearest safe node (a Utility Subsystem, Data Cache, or System Core). When the distance is above 5 the node will still display 5. If a node in a corner displays 5 then you shall change the direction, because there are no useful nodes nearby. When your Strength is low, the route along the edge is suggested. Though a comparatively longer time is needed for hacking in this case, but you could find another way easily and won’t be stuck somewhere. When your Strength is high, choosing the midpoints of the hexagons on the way is suggested, because the safe nodes could be detected easier.

**Hacking strategy:** There is a high possibility that the System Core appears at the opposite angle, so two strategies are recommended. The first one is going straight (diagonal) to the opposite angle like the red line in the image below. It needs a high Strength and you can use this strategy immediately after you have confirmed the difficulty of the minigame. The second one is going along the edge like the green line. This strategy is suitable for the normal sites without the time limit. If a Defensive Subsystem appears, it is not necessary to disable it immediately, because you could change a direction and continue hacking. This strategy has also another advantage when the System Core is not at the opposite angle but at one of the two angles near the start point. When you get a Self Repair, use it ASAP because there is no limit for Coherence. The other Utility Subsystems shall be kept and used according to the table below.

Because of the delay, it could happen that you click accidentally once more and find a Defensive Subsystem near the System Core. So when you are hacking, do not be nervous or click the nodes too fast. When your Coherence is too low for the System Core, do not forget searching in other nodes for the Utility Subsystems. The best way of increasing the success possibility is improving the Strength. 60 Strength could be achieved with T2 Analyzers and Neural Lace 'Blackglass' Net Intrusion 920-40. So the skills for the T2 Data Analyzer shall be trained ASAP.

![logo](https://notwojack.github.io/EVE-Exploration-Guide/image/4.4-1.png ':size=WIDTHxHEIGHT')

**The Rule of Six**
- If a node is adjacent to other six nodes (which build a complete hexagon), then this node is safe.
- When it is not safe, then the System Core must be in one of the six adjacent nodes.

Using this rule could decently increase hacking efficiency. The midpoints of the hexagons are safe. If not, then the System Core is within easy reach. Before a newbie going to explore his/her first Sleeper Cache, it is highly suggested to understand this rule first.

|**Defensive Subsystem**|                                                                                                |        |

# 5 Equipment

The equipment here is about the exploration. The most important factors which affect the exploration are the scanner strength and the Attack. Of course, the equipment for the escape is also important. With a Mobile Depot, the equipment on the ship could be changed anywhere at any time. This can make up the lack of skill points.

## 5.2 High Slot

Recommended for newbies: SOE probes+T1 Core Probe Launcher, cheap but effective. For cloaking, a T2 cloaking device is recommended. An Astero should always be fitted with the Covert Ops cloaking Device II.

## 5.4 Low Slot

For newbies, higher agility is suggested. With two Inertial Stabilizers and one Nanofiber Internal Structure, the align time could be reduced to less than 4s. If there is still a lowslot left, a Sensor Booster is a good option for a further targeting range, which could increase the efficiency. The Warp Core Stabilizers could be refitted for travel.

## 5.5 Rigs

Normally, newbies don’t have enough Scan Strength, so two or more T1 Gravity Capacitor Upgrades shall be fitted. After enough skills have been trained, those Gravity Capacitor Upgrades could be changed into Signal Focusing Kit or Low Friction Nozzle Joints or any other Rigs (e.g. Hyperspatial Velocity Optimizer).
<br>T2 Rigs need normally more Calibration, so simulate first before fitting the Rigs.

(Left: MOTD Right: Overview)

2.	Set the default orbit distance to 2100m: Click any entity and right-click the orbit icon (on the Selected Item window). Now you could set default orbit distance. 
<br>PS: Orbiting at the default orbit distance is only possible by giving the orbit command by the Selected Item window or the Radial Menu, but not by the Context Menu.

## 6.2 Tips & Tricks

**Cloak trick by 784 fvtr**

![logo](https://notwojack.github.io/EVE-Exploration-Guide/image/6.2-1.png)

After jumping through a stargate, double-click anywhere in space (e.g. arrow 1). Pay attention to the cloak icon in the top left corner if it disappears (the arrow 2). Once the cloak icon has disappeared, Cloaking Device shall be activated immediately (e.g. arrow 3) and then activate the MWD (e.g. arrow 4). When the process above is completed, double-click elsewhere in space.
<br>(70% of the current max speed and the aligning are the requirements for entering warp. The right time point for warping shall be decided by your own intuition.)

Advance

1.	There are three kinds of cloak tricks. The first one is the text above and it is the basic one.
2.	The second kind of cloak trick is similar to the first one. The nuance is, that MWD is first activated and then the cloaking device.
3.	The third kind of cloak trick. First align to a moon, then activate MWD, after that activate the cloaking device. Wait until the MWD circle is about at 3/4, then decloak and warp to 0m of the moon.
4.	Any object within 2000m will prevent ships from cloaking and cause cloaked ships to decloak.
5.	The first and second kinds of cloak tricks could be used for gate camp in Nullsec (e.g. case 1). The first one shall be chosen when the internet connection is not good. Otherwise, the second one shall be chosen. The third one could be used in a case without any bubble (e.g. case 2).
6.	In case 1, after completing the cloak trick successfully, decloaking is not suggested when the hostile ships are not leaving. You shall leave the bubble first and have at least 45km+ distance to the hostile ships, then align first, and at the end decloak and warp away.

Clicking this icon ![logo](https://notwojack.github.io/EVE-Exploration-Guide/image/6.2-2.png ':size=WIDTHxHEIGHT') on the D-scan window <br> could show the current D-scan area. Clicking the default shortcut D could scan and show all uncloaked objects in the range. The approximate location of the hostiles could be found out by d-scanning repeatedly with different angles and ranges.

![logo](https://notwojack.github.io/EVE-Exploration-Guide/image/6.2-3.png)

**Safe spots / Deep safes**

![logo](https://notwojack.github.io/EVE-Exploration-Guide/image/6.2-4.png ':size=WIDTHxHEIGHT')

Warp to a planet, save the location with Ctrl+B while warping (e.g. the red dot). <br>
PS: The location of the saved bookmark is determined when "Submit" is clicked, so get ready beforehand. <br>
The safe spots made by the method above are mostly near the center of the system, so they are probably still in the enemy Dscan range. A deep space spot would be safer. When you find a site or wormhole on the outside of the system, it could be a good deep space spot and shall be saved. In the terminal stage you should have at least one deep space spot per system in the area where you explore often. <br>
Tactical bookmarks near the stargates are also necessary, especially for the systems, where the distance between the stargates are >14.3AU. In such a system you can not dscan immediately the enemies camping at another stargate after jumping. A tactical bookmark 150km+ away from the stargate is suggested. <br>

## 6.3 Escape

The operations in the following three cases are all based on T1 frig with a Cloaking Device. It would be easier for Astero. <br>
Before entering the dangerous zones, you could first store the things with high value in an NPC station. In Personal Assets in Neocom you could find where these things are.

**Before jumping**

When you worry about a bubble or someone waiting at the gate, you should first warp to somewhere in 14.3AU from the gate, so that you could dscan the gate. If there is any bubble or many ships there (>5), trying to warp to there for approaching the gate and jumping is not suggested. If there are only a few ships (1-2), trying to jump is worth.

**After jumping**

Don’t be nervous if you are in a bubble. Now you are cloaked for 60s. Switch to the tactical camera and find out where are the ships and where is open. Align (double click) to where is open and activate the MWD and cloaking device at the same time (hotkeys are better than the mouse). Hopefully, you get out of the bubble after the only cycle of MWD. Now you can jump, or wait for a while and watch what the hostile ships are going to do. <br>
Or you don’t try to warp, but approach the gate (overload and activate the MWD). <br>
If there are only a few ships, you could use [the third operation of the cloak trick](对应链接). <br>
If there is any Interdictor, the method is the same as above.

**In the system**

Check the local before exploring. If there is someone else in the local, dscan the sites first. If only dscan cannot judge the danger, you could warp first to 70km and explore, after confirming that nobody is waiting there. Check the local all the time when you are exploring (switch to PVP/警戒, adjust the UI of the Overview so that you can check it all the time. Dscan every 15s. If the align time of your ship is lower than 4s, you don’t have to dscan, but you still need to check the overview.) If any ship shows up, warp immediately to your safe spot and cloak.

**Reacted too slowly**

When the hostile is already in 30km and is locking you, align to the opposite and cloak immediately (make sure nothing is in 2km). Now use [the third operation of the cloak trick](对应链接), activate the MWD and the cloaking device at the same time (the enemy will lose you). But you need to align and be ready for warping before the 3/4 of the only cycle of MWD.

**Worst case**

When the hostile is already on you (in 2km) and you can even not make the cloak trick. Overload the MWD and align to the opposite. Try to activate the Cloaking Device. If you make it, operate the same as above. If you are locked and tackled by disruptor and webbed, you still stand a chance of holding the damage and getting out of the range. Warp immediately when it is possible. <br>
If you are tackled by scrambler, engage the hostile with your ECM drones and hope they will work. Don’t give up trying to warp. At least you can save your pod.

**Introduction of the equipment**  

![logo](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/images/3/35/Icon_warp_disruptor_i.png ':size=WIDTHxHEIGHT')
**Warp Disruptor:** The warpcore disabling strength for the disruptors is 1 point. Disruptors can prevent you from warping but cannot shut down your MWD. T2 Disruptor has 24km basic range (overloaded 28km). It’s not hard to escape while being tackled by it. Overload the MWD, align to the opposite, and warp immediately when it’s possible. 

![logo](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/images/b/b3/Icon_warp_scrambler_i.png ':size=WIDTHxHEIGHT')
**Warp Scrambler:** The warpcore disabling strength for the scramblers is 2 points (faction modules have 3 points). Scramblers can prevent warping and shut down the MWD. T2 Scrambler has 9km basic range (overloaded 10.8km). For an Astero with MWD, being scrambled means normally a new KM.
However, if your ship has Warp Core Stabilizers (normally 2-3, at least 2), warping being tackled is possible, but only when your warp core strengths are more than disabling strengths. The Stabilizer decreases a lot of lock range, which decreases your efficiency of exploration. And it cannot protect the MWD from the Scrambler.

![logo](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/images/2/27/Icon_stasis_webifier_i.png ':size=WIDTHxHEIGHT')
**Stasis Webifier:** The T2 version decreases 60% of the max speed (10km range, 13km when overheated). Normally, an Astero has only less than 200m/s speed when it’s webbed and scrambled.
Normally a Sabre would use 200mm/220mm/280mm Projectile Turrets. So try to hang on in their optimal range and run away from them, but it is hard to survive if you have already been tackled. Your ship is possibly destroyed after two cycles of their turrets. However, if you have ECM drones, the possibility of surviving is bigger though it is hard to ECM a ship with ECM drones.

# 7 Advance

All the following operations are based on the fit [T2 Steel Plates Astero](对应链接) in the Appendix. The valuable things could be stored in a Mobile Depot before the exploration in the advanced sites. Remember to save the location of the wreck after a loss, so that some valuable things could still be looted back. If you are using Stratios or T3C, refer to the data below and other ways could be found. For the main loot please read [Loot](对应链接). Sell those blue loots from the Sleeper Caches to the NPC. In the ingame market, the nearest NPC order could be found. Sell them at best on the way home directly. <br>
All videos for the advanced sites: [Here](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1NW411Z7Cq)

## 7.1 Ghost Sites

There are 4 kinds of ghost sites, all of them are level III Data Sites, but they are level I Combat Sites in the eight drone regions. The Superior Ghost Site only exists in WH space. <br>
Lesser/Standard/Improved/Superior + Faction + Covert Research Facility <br>
There are four cans in total and are arranged as a square or a half-circle. There is a hidden timer from 60s to 240s (time is random), which starts when “warp” is clicked. The timer will not start if you warp cloaked, but the recalibration for locking lasts at least 5s. So you should estimate the time and decloak before landing. <br>
When the timer ends, the NPC ships will warp into the site and tackle you absolutely. When the background music becomes hurried, the timer left is less than 30s. In the hacking minigame, the background music could not be heared. In the improved and superior ghost sites, there are no background music changes as the cue. <br>
The can will explode and cause explosion damage when it gets any damage or the first hacking fails. In more difficult Ghost Sites, the cans also cause higher damage. For tanking the can explosion, high explosion resistance and enough EHP are needed. Except for the cans in superior, the others don’t have hard hacking minigames (basically with green/yellow system core). A T2 data analyzer is suggested. The Ghost Sites are dangerous so the newbies shall use a cheap hull and fit (e.g. Heron) and store the expensive stuff somewhere safe (e.g. in the Mobile Depot).

Attention: Warping while hacking a can is counted as the hacking is failed and then triggers the explosion of the can you were hacking. Do not orbit while your MWD is on, because the ship could fly out of the range of the analyzer (6000m) and the hacking is also failed.

**The concrete process**

1.	Put everything else into the Mobile Depot (included the SOE launcher)(and refit the low slot with three armor explosive hardeners and one 200mm Steel Plates).
2.	Warp cloaked, decloak when the cans appear on the overview so that they could be locked immediately on contact (Without Covert Ops Cloaking Device: warp first to the nearest location to the ghost site, align to it and then warp)
3.	Find out the can with a different name from four and approach it first (don’t need to orbit, keep distance 2100m). Turn on MWD for one cycle.
4.	While you are approaching, turn on the three explosive hardeners, lock all cans, scan them with cargo scanners and confirm the most valuable one. Please first remember the [valuable loots](对应链接) in the ghost sites.
5.	After the hacking, listen to the background music, once it becomes hurried then leave immediately. The Astero with explosive hardener can ignore this music until the NPC ships appear on the overview.
6.	Once the NPC ships appear, the explosive hardener Astero must cloak and leave immediately. A ship with high EHP like Stratios could leave after finishing the current can.

You have about 8s to warp out after the rats have shown on the Overview. Generally, the box will explode after 15s rats landed, and rats will warp out after 30s they landed.

Tips：
1.	An Astero refitted with 3x Explosive Armor Hardener II in low slot will be able to tank once can explosion from an Improved Ghost Site. When rats show up on the grid, cloak first and then warp out. 
2.	You could launch a drone. The NPC ships would first fire on the drone so that you could have a little bit more time.
3.	You could warp to within 10km and would be nearer to a can.

Can explosion damage formula: <br>
Real damage = Can explosion damage X (1 - explosion resistance) <br>
Exp.：A can in Improved explodes and the ship is an Astero with 88% explosion resistance from armor <br>
Received damage = 10000 X（1 - 0.88）= 1200 <br>
It means if the astero has more than 1200 armor, then it won't be destroyed by the explosion. (Shield and Structure could also be counted in.) <br>

## 7.2 Gas Sites

In some Regions from Lowsec and Nullsec (Read [Appendix](对应链接). In the hot-spot Constellations, there is a high possibility that the Gas Sites appear. The possibility of the appearance in the whole Region is lower. In the other Regions, the gas sites will never appear.), the Gas Sites with the region-specific type of nebula and Combat Gas Sites will appear.
Normally the NPC ships should be cleaned first before hacking any can, but the cans are not locked (which means they could be hacked without destroying all NPC ships there), so if the NPC ships are drawn away, hacking cans directly is possible. The main income is from the Skill Books and BPC of Boosters. In Lowsec, the NPC ships do not always have to be drawn away, if you explore with [T2 Steel Plates Astero](对应链接). Just warp in and hack the cans. In Nullsec the NPC ships have to be drawn away.

**The concrete process**

1.	Warp to 0m, save the location when about 2000-8000km distance left.
2.	After warping, scan and mark the valuable cans. (In Nullsec, align immediately to the saved bookmark in 1 after warping, then scan and mark the cans and draw the NPC ships >40km away from the cans.)
3.	Warp to the saved bookmark in 1, wait until your armor is fully repaired. Now warp again to the can (0m) and begin hacking.
4.	Repeat 3, until all marked cans are hacked.

Distribution Base

Level IV cosmic signature

3-9 cans inside. When cloaked, some of them are hidden. <br>
In this signature, the cans are all located near the structures, so it is easy to get stuck in the structure and get destroyed. Because of this, adjust your position first after landing. Then orbit 500m and begin hacking after you confirmed that you won’t be stuck there. <br>
Sometimes two Industrials could appear inside the signature, they may drop BPC. (They could be scanned with cargo scanner.)

Loot: Skill Books, Implants, Standard/Improved Booster BPC, and Reaction Formula (small possibility: Strong BPC and Reaction Formula)

**Nullsec:**

![logo](https://notwojack.github.io/EVE-Exploration-Guide/image/7.2-5.png ':size=WIDTHxHEIGHT')

Production Facility	

Level IV cosmic signature (could be a combat sig)

3-9 cans inside. Two neut towers inside (50km range). An Astero would lose immediately all cap and NPC elite frigs would tackle, so always draw the NPC ships first away. (Cycle the MWD and draw them >50km away from the cans.)
Sometimes a boss with a unique name could appear (cruiser or battleship), may drop BPC with 50-200 runs. (Some could be scanned by cargo scanner, some not because they are immune to EWAR.)

Digital "Site"

Level III/IV cosmic signature (could be a combat sig)

A combat gas site with the name beginning with "Digital", which includes many cans and acceleration gates. The difficulty of them is about the same as 6/10, a Gila could clear the whole site.
There is a detailed introduction about them in 7.2.1.

The Level III nebulas and combat gas sites will disappear in 1 hour after any can inside has been hacked. But the Level IV combat gas sites could exist for three days. All cans inside would be refreshed after DT, so they could be farmed. Scan and save their locations before DT and explore them after DT immediately. It is an easy way to earn ISK for the new players, but some luck is also important. Looking for the skill books in the whole region but finding nothing at the end is possible.

### 7.2.1 Combat Gas Sites

Combat Gas Sites' names and regions

|Name                |Region            |
|:------------------:|:----------------:|
|Digital Matrix      |Feythabolis       |
|Digital Network     |Wicked Creek      |
|Digital Complex     |Delve             |
|Digital Plexus      |Vale of the Silent|
|Digital Convolution |Tenal             |
|Digital Circuitry   |Catch             |
|Digital Compound    |Fountain          |
|Digital Tessellation|Cloud Ring        |

The structures of the “Digital” sites in different regions are similar. Here is an example of Digital Convolution in Tenal. This introduction is about how to explore the “Digital” sites with an Astero. Thank EVO 3016 and 784 fvtr for the information. <br>
The difficulty is about the same as 6/10. A Gila could clear the whole site and T3C could finish the site without clearing it.

**1st pocket**

![logo](https://notwojack.github.io/EVE-Exploration-Guide/image/7.2.1-1.png ':size=WIDTHxHEIGHT')

After taking the acceleration gate, there are two gates in the 1st pocket. The gate on the left side leads to the 2nd pocket and the another one on the right side leads to the 3rd pocket. The loots in the 2nd pocket are the skill books. The loots in the 3rd pocket are the standard booster BPCs. Just cycle the MWD and approach the gate to the 2nd pocket. If you are afraid of being destroyed, you could activate the MWD and cloak, then approach patiently. Watch out the entities, align once somewhere else first for avoiding them before approaching the gate.

**2nd pocket**

![logo](https://notwojack.github.io/EVE-Exploration-Guide/image/7.2.1-2.png ':size=WIDTHxHEIGHT')

After landing, orbit the cans inside the red circle and scan them quickly. On the left and the right side of the circle, there are two cans. There are NPC ships protecting them and would fire on you if you hack them (DPS about the same as the Gas Sites in LS.) Watch out the Local because the NPC reinforcements may appear (4 tackle frigs and 4 battlecruisers). Astero could destroy the frigs with drones but needs to warp out of the site and come back, then only four battlecruisers would fire on you. The gate to the 3rd pocket could be ignored. Instead of it, going to the 3rd pocket with the gate in the 1st pocket is suggested. <br>
If the site is in an area of Blue Pill or Exile or Mindflood, exploring the 3rd pocket is meaningful. In other areas, exploring the 1st and 2nd pockets is enough.

**3rd pocket**

![logo](https://notwojack.github.io/EVE-Exploration-Guide/image/7.2.1-3.png ':size=WIDTHxHEIGHT')

After landing, there are many NPC ships near you. Cycle your MWD and align to the opposite immediately. The frigs in this pocket also have tackle modules. Draw most NPC ships >30km away from the landing point, then warp out of the site and come back. Cycle the MWD and approach the cans. Scan them first and hack them. If the site is in an area of Blue Pill or Exile or Mindflood, going to the 4th pocket is suggested (Strong booster BPC mostly appear in loot.), but activating the gate to the 4th pocket needs you to destroy all NPC ships in 3rd pocket first. The amount of NPC ships in the 4th pocket is similar to 3rd pocket. There are also frigs with tackle modules.

PS: The cosmic signature disappears after I have had hacked the cans for one hour. The destroyed NPC ships will not be refreshed before DT, so it could be farmed.

## 7.3 Limited Sleeper Cache

Limited Sleeper Cache is a level IV Data Site. It needs 85+ Probe strength and most hacking minigames inside are red-difficulty. The loot value is around 20m. Only the frigate class ships could enter the site. The whole site is not very hard.

![logo](https://notwojack.github.io/EVE-Exploration-Guide/image/7.3-1.png ':size=WIDTHxHEIGHT')

The image above is a planform of a Limited Sleeper Cache. The green and yellow clouds would damage the ship (100DPS with 0% resistance). The force field at the bottom left stops your ship from approaching the cans.

|Name                        |Note         |Success                                              |Failure                                                |

Just be careful.

## 7.4 Standard Sleeper Cache

Standard Sleeper Cache is a level IV Data Site. It needs 95+ probe strength and has about 60m-200m loot value. Most hacking minigames are red-difficulty. Except the cans with loot inside, the other containers need data analyzer. T2 analyzers are suggested. How to deal with an explored Standard Sleeper Cache would be introduced at the end of this chapter.

### 7.4.1 Basic Guide

Online video:
<iframe height=480px src="//player.bilibili.com/player.html?aid=31057239&bvid=BV1NW411Z7Cq&page=2" scrolling="no" border="0" frameborder="no" framespacing="0" allowfullscreen="true" ></iframe>

1.	Hack the Hyperfluct Generator, and scan the three cans after warping. Hack and take the things in them (except the furthest can) if the loot inside are valuable. Then hack the Remote Defense Grid Unit, a Sentry Tower would be moved.

2.	Hack those three Coordinate Plotting Devices. Put the Calibration Coordinates into Remote Calibration Device - High Power. Activate the Rift and warp to the Sleeper Enclave area.

3.	After landing, orbit and hack the Remote Defense Grid Unit nearby. After hacking successfully, launch the drones and destroy the Sentry Tower. Then hack the cans.

4.	Save your location now, then warp out of the site and come back to the Logistic area. Hack the the furthest can called Mangled Storage Depot, then hack the new spawned Defense Alarm Unit near it.
    > If succeed: Hack the new spawned Pristine Storage Depot and go to the Tractor Beam area. <br>
    > If fail: Cycle your MWD and align vertically downwards until 120km distance, where the Guardian does not exist. Then go to the Rift near the Immobile Tractor Beam while avoiding the Guardian and enter the 2nd pocket. (Jump to step 6)

5.	Approach the Sentry Tower in the Tractor Beam area manually with enough angular velocity and destroy it with the drones. Hack the Remote Defense Grid Unit and fail the hacking minigame manually until the Guardian is activated. Align vertically downwards and cycle your MWD until 80km distance. Enter the 2nd pocket after the Rift appears.

6.	After arriving at the 2nd pocket, approach the Beacon until the Remote Defense Grid Unit (10km away) appears. Hack it and scan the four cans spawned. Hack the two most valuable cans first, then hack the Self-Destruct Unit. After hacking this Unit successfully, go on hacking the other two cans.

### 7.4.2 Sections Introduction

**Please read it carefully with the Basic Guide together.**

**Entry** <br>
Hyperfluct Generator <br>
Requirement: Data Analyzer <br>
Success: the Rift appears <br>
Failure: 2mins long timer. If the Generator is still not being hacked successfully before the timer ends, it will self destruct (without damage).

Before entering the 1st pocket, the alarm mechanism is first introduced here. <br>
**Alarm level:** One alarm level would be raised by once failure from hacking. There are five levels in total and at every level the Guardian could appear. At level 5 the Guardian will always appear.

![logo](https://notwojack.github.io/EVE-Exploration-Guide/image/7.4.2-1.png ':size=WIDTHxHEIGHT')

**Guardian:** Not NPC ships, but a kind of cloud with AOE damage. Before the appearance, it would be indicated in the local channel. Once the 30s long timer begins (the red text in the image above), cycle your MWD and align vertically downwards immediately. At first the range of Guardian is only 30km, after 30s it will spread out until about 70km (DPS before spreading: 400/s, 100 per damage type) (DPS after spreading: 1000/s, 250 per damage type). Attacking the structure Sleeper Enclave would trigger the 30s alarm immediately. After the appearance of the Guardian (with any method), the Rift to the second pocket would appear at the Tractor Beam. And the entrance location of the first pocket would be moved to another beacon, which is outside of the Guardian and near that new Rift.

**1st pocket** <br>
three areas: 1. Logistic area &nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Tractor Beam area &nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Sleeper Enclave area

**Sleeper Enclave area**

![logo](https://notwojack.github.io/EVE-Exploration-Guide/image/7.4.2-4.png ':size=WIDTHxHEIGHT')

This area could be arrived by activating the Calibrated Long Rift. The locked target in the image is the Remote Defense Grid Unit which is going to be hacked. The Sentry Tower further away shall be destroyed. The hidden cans are on the right side.

### 7.4.3 Advanced Walkthrough

**Process for Stratios/T2 Steel Plates Astero without destroying Sentry Towers** (Uses bug, fast speed, need enough EHP)

1.	After entering the 1st pocket, scan and hack the valuable cans, then hack the furthest can Mangled Storage Depot. Finish the new spawned Defense Alarm Unit and Pristine Storage Depot afterward.

2.	Hack the Remote Defense Grid Unit in the Logistic area but fail the hacking minigame manually so that the Guardian could appear. Avoid the Guardian.

3.	Go to the Tractor Beam area. Hack quickly the Remote Defense Grid Unit there while the Sentry Tower is firing on you. Then enter the 2nd pocket.

4.	Save your location after finishing the 2nd pocket, then warp out of the site and come back to the 1st pocket. Go to the Tractor Beam area and hack the Tractor Beam Unit. After waiting, hack the pulled hidden Depots. The Sentry Towers won’t fire on you but the Remote Defense Grid Unit which was hacked before.

**Farm a Standard Sleeper Cache**

If the Dented, Intact and Mangled Storage Depots are not hacked, the cosmic signature will not disappear. In this case, the six pulled hidden Depots would be refreshed after DT and you can hack them again. The cans in the 2nd pocket would also be refreshed.

**How to deal with an explored Standard Sleeper Cache**

After entering the 1st pocket, observe the Tractor Beam area. <br>
If the Tractor Beam area is covered by the Guardian, it means the site was explored before last DT and the Guardian has no damage. The basic guide could be used. <br>
If not, it means this site was explored in the same DT period. You shall not enter the Guardian, but the process above without destroying Sentry Towers is still able to be used. Pull and hack the hidden cans with the Tractor Beam, then go to the 2nd pocket. Just give up the cans in the Logistic area.

## 7.5 Superior Sleeper Cache

Superior Sleeper Cache is a level V Data Site. It needs 104+ probe strength and has about 120m-300m loot value. Almost every hacking minigame is red-difficulty. Except the cans with loot, the other cans need a Data Analyzer. T2 analyzers with Blackglass are strongly suggested. <br>
Superior Sleeper Cache could be divided into four parts. The Archive is more dangerous than the others. How to deal with an explored Superior Sleeper Cache would be introduced at the end of this chapter.

1.	Hack the Hyperfluct Generator, and start exploring in Solar Power Plant. (If you are not landed in Solar Power Plant, go back and start there.) 

2.	Hack the Solray Observational Unit in the Mid-area and put the Modulate Disc into the Alignment Unit with the right name.

3.	Scan the cans in the cloud (in the Mid-area) and hack the valuable ones. Then go to the Rift in the Near-area and enter the pocket called Sentries on Duty.

4.	Keep range with the Remote Defense Grid Unit on the left side and hack it (if failed, leave this pocket immediately). After hacking it successfully, activate your MWD and approach the Sentry Repair Station on the right side. Hack it immediately.

5.	Once all Sentry Towers have been destroyed, hack the nine Depots there.

6.	(One Depot in The Archive could be hacked relatively safely.)

**Optional**

7.	Go back to the Solar Power Plant, launch a Mobile Depot and store everything in your cargo there (also the Sisters Probe Launcher). Refit out the explosive armor hardener and take some Nanite Repair Pastes. Save your location.

8.	Go to the Far-area and hack the Remote Reroute Unit. Then go back to the Mid-area and warp by using the Rift there to the Mine Room. Activate the explosive hardener before warping.

9.	[Guide for the Mine Room: Chapter 7.5.5](对应链接)

10.	After finishing the Mine Room, warp out of the site and come back. Store the new loot into your Mobile Depot and go to the Sentries on Duty. Hack the Hyperfluct Generator in that pocket and enter The Archive. If the Hyperfluct Generator needs to be powered up, read [Chapter 7.5.4](对应链接).

11.	[Guide for The Archive: Chapter 7.5.6](对应链接)

**The following text includes the introductions to different areas and pockets, please read it carefully with the Basic Guide together.**

### 7.5.2 Entry

Hyperfluct Generator <br>
Requirement: Data Analyzer <br>
Success: A Spatial Rift appears. <br>
Failure: 2mins long timer. If the Generator is still not being hacked successfully before it ends, it will self destruct (without damage). <br>
After activating the Rift, you could land in one of the following three locations. Please activate the Rift nearby (if not landed in the Near-area in Solar Power Plant), so that you could go to the Near-area and start there.
1.	Near-area in Solar Power Plant
2.	Far-area in Solar Power Plant (activate the Rift nearby to go to the Near-area)
3.	Sentries on Duty (activate the Rift nearby to go to the Near-area)

### 7.5.3 Solar Power Plant

The Solar Power Plant is divided into three areas: Near-area, Mid-area and Far-area. The cans in the Mid-area are in the clouds (600DPS, only EM).

### 7.5.4 Sentries on Duty

Before all Sentry Towers have been destroyed, do not let the drones or yourself go across the red line. If hacking the Remote Defense Grid Unit is failed, the only choice is giving up this pocket (and The Archive).

![logo](https://notwojack.github.io/EVE-Exploration-Guide/image/7.5.4-1.png ':size=WIDTHxHEIGHT')

|Name                                      |Note|Success|Failure|
|:-----------------------------------------|:---|:------|:------|
|Spatial Rift                              |    | to Mid-area in Solar Power Plant | |
|2x Wakeful+Vigilant+Restless Sentry Towers|    | These Sentry Towers will not attack you if you do not go across the red line. One Tower deals 400-700 damages, by wrecking 1500+ damage. | |
|Remote Defense Grid Unit                  | If hacking this Unit is failed, this pocket could only be given up. | The nearest Sentry Tower becomes friendly and begins to attack the other Towers. It could only be repaired by the Repair Station. | A 45s long timer (would be indicated in local channel) begins. 16 Towers will spawn when this timer ends, no matter if you succeed or fail by the second attempt. |
|Sentry Repair Station                     | Hacking it is optional. | Repair the friendly Sentry Tower. | Nothing |
|9x Storage Depots                         |    | Is able to be opened | Nothing |
|3x Unstable Plasma Chambers               | Blue circle (left) | They will explode and power up the Generator if anyone is attacked. Deal 100000 explosive damage and produce a cloud (with damage) there. After 60s, 16 Towers will spawn. | |
|Hyperfluct Generator                      | In the middle of the Depots | 1. Rift to The Archive appears <br> 2. It's unavailable and needs to be powered up. Attack the Chambers for powering up. | Nothing |
|Vessel Rejuvenation Battery               | Blue circle (right) | It provides about 10s long invincibility. The combination with attacking the Chamber is needed for powering up. | Nothing |

PS: If and only if the Remote Defense Grid Unit has been hacked successfully, going across the red line would trigger a "special alarm", which is different from the "normal alarm", and 10 Sentry Towers will spawn. By failing to hack the Remote Defense Grid Unit or attacking actively the Towers or attacking the Chambers, the "normal alarm" would be triggered and 16 Sentry Towers will spawn. <br>
In Sentries on Duty, that glitch Bug could also be used. Even when you fail to hack Remote Defense Grid Unit, if you could tank the Towers and hack one can successfully, then warp out of the site and come back, now all Towers are firing on that can.

**Power up the Hyperfluct Generator**

<iframe height=480px src="//player.bilibili.com/player.html?aid=31057239&bvid=BV1NW411Z7Cq&cid=54290881&page=9" scrolling="no" border="0" frameborder="no" framespacing="0" allowfullscreen="true"> </iframe>

Launch first only one drone and hack the Vessel Rejuvenation Battery. When you find the core, don’t finish the minigame immediately. Now let your drone engage with the Chamber and finish the minigame when the drone is halfway to the Chamber. The Hyperfluct Generator is now powered up and you have only 60s for hacking the Generator again. Whether you succeed or fail, 16 Towers will spawn after 60s. <br>
The explosion damage from the Chambers would be lowered to about 400 after the Vessel Rejuvenation Battery has been hacked successfully. Destroying the ships from the others is impossible.

### 7.5.5 Mine Room

If you have 30k+ EHP, then you don’t need to worry about the mine explosions, but 100k+ EHP is needed for failed hacking. <br>
Receiving damage is possible while warping. If the operation is right, the Mine Room could be cleared without receiving any damage.

**Mine Room mechanism:** After warping, approach the hidden Remote Defense Grid Unit. After hacking it, some mines would be shown on your Overview. For looking at the mines, you have to zoom in and move the camera. The hidden mines still exist and the locations of the mines are always the same. Some Depots may also be shown up after hacking the Defense Unit. There are three Depots in total in the Mine Room. They are hidden and the locations are also fixed. One would be shown up if your ship is in 10km. The following images could be used as a reference for the locations. <br>
When your ship is in 10km from a mine, it will explode. The damage from a mine could be different (2000, 3000, 4500, 5500, 6000 or 7500, damage type only explosive). 1-3 mines would explode at one time. If your speed is too fast, the mines may explode continuously. Normally, a plate Astero with 88%+ explosive resistance would not be destroyed by the mines. The locations of the three Depots are shown in the following images. Set the beacon as origin, the Depots could be found by controlling the ship manually.

|Name                    |Note            |Success|Failure|
|:-----------------------|:---------------|:------|:------|
|Remote Defense Grid Unit|Shows up in 10km| 1-3 Depots and some mines will show up. | All mines will explode (20-25 mines). |
|3x Storage Depots       |                | Is able to be opened | Nothing |

Route without receiving any damage (online video)

<iframe height=480px src="//player.bilibili.com/player.html?aid=31057239&bvid=BV1NW411Z7Cq&cid=72490091&page=8" scrolling="no" border="0" frameborder="no" framespacing="0" allowfullscreen="true"> </iframe>

**This video and the following text is based on 1920x1080 image resolution and 100% UI Scaling. If your settings are different (e.g. 4K), you have to find the location by yourself.**

Approach the beacon on contact. Then approach and hack Remote Defense Grid Unit once it shows up (not necessary, but your ship would be certainly destroyed if you fail). <br>
For the Dented Depot: Activate the MWD for 1 cycle and go along the tick mark. <br>
For the Pristine Depot: Adjust the camera so that the 100km tick mark is the outermost one. Double click the bottom right from the fourth module in lowslot. Activate the MWD for 2 cycles at the same time. <br>
For the Intact Depot: Rise vertically from the beacon to 5700-6100m distance. Then adjust the camera so that the 100km tick mark is the outermost one. Double click the 30km tick mark on the right side. Activate the MWD for 2 cycles at the same time. <br>
Pay attention to the distances from the beacon to three cans (in the video). Once the can doesn’t show up at the right distance, stop the ship immediately. Now go back to the beacon and try again.

**How to tank the explosion from the mines with Astero**

注意：技能不足的情况下55爆抗只能超载4轮，如果装备双64爆抗，不需要超载。全部使用保持距离。被雷炸到后马上停船维修好血量再前进 Always use keeping range. Once the ship is damaged by any mine, stop immediately and don’t move again until the ship is repaired. <br>
Equip with two explosive hardeners. Put the lowslot modules like on the right image so that four overheated cycles won’t damage any other module completely. Click the small circle (the arrow on the image on the right side) to pre-overheat all modules in the lowslot.

### 7.5.6 The Archive

There is much debris (Smoldering Archive Ruins) in The Archive, they are all enwrapped by the clouds (400DPS, 100 per damage type). Wrecking by the cloud is possible (800 damage). An Astero should never be to close to them. Go directly to the Defense Targeting Augmentation after landing will not enter any cloud.

|Name                             |Note|Success|Failure|
|:--------------------------------|:---|:------|:------|
|Defense Targeting Augmentation   |    | Lower greatly the hit chance from the Sentry Towers. | Towers will spawn.|
|3x Cerebrum Maintenance Chambers |    | Is able to be opened | Towers will spawn. |
|4x Impaired Archive Sentry Towers|    | Spawn condition: 1. failure by hacking	2. after the Central Archive Cerebrum has been activated <br> Every Tower deals about 700 damage. Its rate of fire is 12s. | |
|Central Archive Cerebrum         |    | Activated by three Intravenous Oscillation Fluids. Putting first the other two kinds of items is suggested (each kind three of them). |                              |
|10x Storage Depots               |    | Is able to be opened | Nothing |
|3x Vessel Rejuvenation Batterys  |    | 90s long repair cloud spawns, which could repair your ship completely in 1s. | Nothing |

**The Archive mechanism:** The timer begins once the Central Archive Cerebrum has been activated. The first shock wave arrives after 90s. After that, the longer you stay, the more often the shock waves come. Every wave lasts 5s. Except the first shock wave would be indicated in the local channel, when the other shock waves arrive is not certain (the first few shock waves: 20-40s). Multi shock waves (max 3) may arrive at the same time. The first three times are very likely made of only one shock wave. One colossal wave (DPS: 3x shock waves) would arrive after the Central Archive Cerebrum has been activated for 6m30s. A shock wave has 2400 DPS (600 per type), in total, 12000 damage for 5s. <br>
The Depots appear slowly after the Cerebrum has been activated. After 30s, all nine cans would appear. One Vessel Rejuvenation Battery (3 in total) would appear once the Cerebrum has been activated. The second one appears after about 2m20s and the third one about after 4m30s. 90s long invincibility would be provided once the Battery has been hacked successfully, but only in 5000m range. **At present, the information shows that only the Vessel Rejuvenation Battery in Area ① would work.**

![logo](https://notwojack.github.io/EVE-Exploration-Guide/image/7.5.6-1.png ':size=WIDTHxHEIGHT')

Locations of the Depots: There is one Battery (blue circles) every three Depots (red circles). The last Depot left is far away and in the cloud. A Depot could be replaced by a Sentry Tower or an empty Depot. <br>
Danger in three areas: <br>
Area ①: There is no danger in Area ①. Approaching any Depot is safe. <br>
Area ②: The Depot outboard and the Battery are safe. Those two Depots inside are close to the debris. <br>
Area ③: The Depot outboard is safe. The Battery and the other two Depots inside are close to the debris. <br>
The Depot far away (not in any area) is in 500m from the debris entity.

**Guide for The Archive:**

Use carefully the MWD in The Archive. Always stop the ship in time so that you will not rush into the cloud.

**Before activating the Cerebrum:**

Hack the Defense Targeting Augmentation after landing. Then fail first once manually by hacking a Chamber so that the Towers could spawn. When your Astero is orbiting the Chamber, the Towers couldn’t hit you. Now hack that Chamber successfully and a Depot will spawn (you could hack and loot it). After that, warp out of the site and come back to The Archive (Attention: If the Generator in Sentries on Duty was powered up, then the Towers would spawn in Sentries on Duty). You will find out that the Towers are firing on the Defense Targeting Augmentation hacked by you before (same bug as that one used in Standard Sleeper Cache). <br>
Putting three Intravenous Oscillation Fluids into the Cerebrum could activate it, but putting first three Self-regulating Machine Gears and three Nanoplastic Membrane Patches into it is suggested, which could reduce the possibility, that the Towers and empty Depots appear. Gears and Nano Patches are not always enough, you shall take them with you for the next time you explore in Superior Sleeper Cache. <br>
Before activating the Cerebrum, set the default distance by keeping range to 2200m and by orbiting to 1000m. Turn off the Auto-Repeat by the MWD.

**After activating the Cerebrum:**

Risk warning: Make sure that you have already put everything valuable into your Mobile Depot before you start. If the 15s timer appears in local channel, which means you don’t have enough time for hacking the Vessel Rejuvenation Battery, please leave there quickly and decisively.

1.	Only hack 2-3 valuable Depots (medium risk):
After activating the Cerebrum, cycle once your MWD and approach the cans in Area ①. Keeping range is enough (if new Sentry Towers are spawned, do not keep range but orbit). Scan the Depots in Area ① at the same time, mark and order them by value and hack the most valuable one. Then hack the Vessel Rejuvenation Battery but wait until the first shock wave is indicated in local channel. Now finish the hacking minigame. Wait there until the first shock wave is over. After that, approach and hack immediately the second valuable Depot. Then go back to the Vessel Rejuvenation Battery in Area ①, wait until the second shock wave is over and hack the third Depot.

**Tanking the shock waves while hacking**

By using an Astero with two armor plates or armor plate Stratios. (EHP > 12060 could tank one shock wave. Astero needs to fit two T2 Small Trimark Armor Pumps and change the armor repairer to a steel plate. All following operations are all based on that in the first three waves, only one shock wave comes at one time. Once more shock waves would come at the same time, hide at the Vessel Rejuvenation Battery or leave immediately)

2.	Maximum loot (**high** risk):
After activating the Cerebrum, activate the MWD and approach the nearest Vessel Rejuvenation Battery. Keeping range is enough (if there are Sentry Towers firing on you, do not keep range but orbit). Scan the cans in Area ① at the same time and mark the most valuable one. After hacking this one, scan and mark the most valuable can in Area ②. Approach (MWD on) first the safe Depot in Area ②, wait until your speed is again slow, then approach your target can in Area ②. Now you need to tank the first shock wave. After hacking this can, go immediately back to the Vessel Rejuvenation Battery and hack it ASAP. If a new timer appears in local, which indicates a new shock wave, before you have finished hacking the Battery, you shall give up and leave right away. Scan the cans in Area ③ while you are waiting inside the repair cloud and mark two valuable cans in Area ③. (If there are still valuable cans in Area ① you could hack them now.) Calculate the time and go immediately to the Vessel Rejuvenation Battery (keep range or orbit) in Area ③ when the shock wave is gone. You shall first finish hacking those two marked cans and then loot them together. If both cans are inside, after looting one can you have to approach first the can outside in Area ③ and then loot the second can, or you would receive damage from the cloud at debris. At the same time, pay attention to the indication timer of the shock waves in local. You shall leave once the third wave is gone. In total, five cans: two cans in Area ①, one can in Area ② and two cans in Area ③, are looted.

3.	Loot all cans with Astero (Congratulations on @Tu Boshu, who made on 29 Sep. 2020)
After activating the Cerebrum, approach (MWD on) first the debris near Area ①. Stop when there is still 13km distance left and approach the first can in Area ①. Then approach (not keep range) the safe can in Area ②. After hacking it, go hack the can above that safe can in Area ②. (Use keep range, don’t open the can until the distance between you and the can is stable. If you press open when the distance is still >2500m, you will automatically approach it and may rush into the cloud at the debris) Here you have to tank the first shock wave. If you hacked quickly enough and the first shock wave has still not arrived, you could hack the can below in Area ②. Use keep range. Then go immediately back to the Vessel Rejuvenation Battery and hack it. Now approach (MWD on) the safe can in Area ③ and hack it. After that, hack (keep range) the can on the right side (you have to tank the second shock wave at the same time). Until here, you can make it stably if you have enough speed and experience (in total 1+3+2=6 cans looted. Online Video). For the last three cans you would need luck. <br>
If the repair cloud is now ended, go to the last can in Area ③ but pay attention to the third shock wave. If you could hack it quickly enough, go back to the repair cloud in Area ① (it needs to last until the third shock wave is finished) and hack the last can in Area ① after repairing. Now go (keep range) to the last can in Area ③. If the fourth wave has luckily only one shock wave, then you could make it. <br>
From activating the Cerebrum to the indication of the fifth wave in local, there are normally about 250s-300s, 10 cans have to be hacked in total.

4.	Loot all with Tengu:
EHP fit: The core of this fit is hacking all cans before the colossal wave at 6min30s. The shock waves before are normally not more than eight, so if you have 100k+ EHP, you could tank all shock waves before the colossal wave. <br>
Normal fit: Pithum A-Type Medium Shield Booster, Pithum C-Type Multispectrum Shield Hardener, Pith X-Type EM Shield Hardener and Large Shield Extenders. It could tank the shock wave and be repaired before the next wave. If multiple shock waves appear at the same time, the Shield Booster shall be overheated moderately. Leave before the colossal wave at 6min30s.

### 7.5.7 Fast Walkthrough

1.	If you land at ......
    > Far-area: Hack Remote Reroute Unit and activate the Rift. Then go to Near-area and activate the Rift there. <br>
    > Near-area: Activate the Rift <br>
    > Sentries on Duty: Stay
2.	Now you are in Sentries on Duty, launch the Mobile Depot and save its location. Hack the Remote Defense Grid Unit and the Sentry Repair Station, then go back to the Mid-area in Solar Power Plant. 
3.	Hack the Solray Observational Unit and take the Modulate Disc. Scan and mark the cans inside the cloud.
4.	If the corresponding Alignment Unit is ......
    > Infrared Alignment Unit: put the Modulate Disc into it and hack the marked cans inside the cloud. <br>
    > in Near- or Far-area: continue according to step 5.
5.	Activate the Rift in Mid-area (put the Modulate Disc in Far-area) and hack the Reroute Unit in Far-area. Then activate the Rift in Far-area and go back to Near-area (put the Modulate Disc in Near-area).
6.	Activate the Rift and go to Sentries on Duty. Equip your Astero with two explosive armor hardeners at Mobile Depot. Hack the cans there. Then go back to the Mid-area (hack the cans inside the cloud). After that, go to Mine Room.
7.	After finishing Mine Room, warp out of the site and come back. Go to Sentries on Duty and change your equipments. (If the Hyperfluct Generator in Sentries on Duty needed to be powered up, you could wait after the exploration in The Archive out of the site until it is disappeared, then pick up your Depot.) Go to The Archive, let the Sentry Towers spawn by failing once hacking manually and hack that spawned Depot.
8.	After finishing The Archive (what means finished is decided by you), warp out of the site and come back once again. Reclaim the Mobile Depot.

**How to deal with an explored Superior Sleeper Cache**

Please don’t enter the site directly, because being destroyed immediately is possible. First, check on zkill for anyone destroyed by Sentry Towers in three days. <br>
If yes, then someone failed clearly in Sentries on Duty. Jump to 2. <br>
There is only a small possibility that someone survived from failing in Sentries on Duty. The safest plan is entering the site after DT.

1.	Failure in Solar Power Plant
    > A newbie could put the Modulate Disc into a wrong Alignment Unit. Check all three Alignment Units. If their names are all Unaligned then the Modulate Disc is in a wrong Unit. An Astero could only give the cans in the cloud up (a Stratios could hack them while tanking the damage).
2.	Failure in Sentries on Duty
    > Check the Hyperfluct Generator at the Entry. If its full, it means the failure was before last DT. The Sentry Towers spawned by alarm are hidden, but in 3-5s after you entered Sentries on Duty, they would be reactivated. However, in this case you still could activate the Rift nearby immediately and return to Solar Power Plant safely and hack the cans there (if they are not hacked before). Or hack the Generator again and get a Rift to Solar Power Plant. If the Generator is empty, do not enter. 22 Sentry Towers are waiting for you. (An Astero with 8500+ EHP could possibly survive the first round. You could take the risk, warp in and then try warping back to Solar Power Plant immediately.)

## 7.6 Advanced Tips

To increase the efficiency by exploring, this chapter would introduce some tips.

### 7.6.1 One Probing

by 十月

Example: 120 probe strength, 8AU probe size. Scan with only 1 probe. <br>
After first time scanning, if the signal is…… <br>
above 8.6%+, its normally a level II or I signal. <br>
between 5-8.5%, its normally a level III signal. <br>
between 3-5%, its normally a level IV signal. <br>
under 2%, its normally a Sleeper Cache. <br>
If you get a “two dot” result, then x2. If the result is a circle, x4. If the result is a sphere and the signal is under 1%, reposition and try again.

Common signals <br>
Level III: Ghost Sites, Gas Sites (Two kinds of sites with towers. Another kind is Nebula) <br>
Level IV: two kinds of Sleeper Caches, one Gas Site (no tower in Lowsec, with Energy Neutralizer Towers in Nullsec), faction shipyards and dens or normal faction Relic Sites <br>
Level V: Superior Sleeper Cache (or Silent Battleground, only in WH) <br>
When you are specialized in exploration, normally you would only scan these three kinds of signals and leave the level I and II signals alone. After you entered a system, you only scan first with 8AU size and clear the results above 8.6% (right click->Ignore), then scan the signals left. When you are travelling in Highsec, you could also scan once with 8AU size while warping to checking if there are Ghost Sites or Superior Sleeper Cache. With this measure, you could find the Superior Sleeper Cache efficiently.

**Distinguishing the signals without probing**

Sleeper Caches are normally more than 6AU away from a planet. <br>
Ghost Sites are normally about 5AU away from a planet. <br>
Gas ,Relic and Data Sites are normally in 4AU away from a planet. <br>
So normally, the signal with higher level has also larger sphere and this sphere dont often include a planet. After you have enough experience, you could find the Superior Sleeper Cache at the first moment. Another kind of signal, which could be more than 6AU away from a planet, is Wormhole. A signal, for example in the following images, which doesnt include a planet and couldnt be covered by the 8AU spheres, has a great chance to be a Superior Sleeper Cache. <br>
If you find a level IV signal, you could warp to the nearest planet. If the distance between you and the planet is less than 4AU, it should be a shipyard. If the distance is more than 5AU, its normally a Standard Sleeper Cache.

Up: the size of the Standard Sleeper Cache <br>
Down: Both ways could clear the unneeded results.

### 7.6.2 Shortcut

Here are the commonly used shortcuts for exploration and the suggested keys for them. Use the shortcuts skillfully is necessary for exploring efficiently (also for exploring the whole Superior Sleeper Cache). Most shortcuts will only take effect by first pressing them and then clicking the target by mouse.

### 7.6.3 Interface

![logo](https://notwojack.github.io/EVE-Exploration-Guide/image/7.6.3-1.png ':size=WIDTHxHEIGHT')

The image above is my suggested standard UI for exploring (based on 1080p display). If yours is 768p, you could remove the chat on the left side and move the HUD (move the mouse to the capacitor and hold left-click). After all settings, the UI would be saved and the next time you open a window, it would be at the same place.

Emphasis:

1.	Move the Lock Target List to the place above the HUD below. Find the dot on the right image, which enables you to move its Anchor Position. ![logo](https://notwojack.github.io/EVE-Exploration-Guide/image/7.6.3-2.png ':size=WIDTHxHEIGHT')
2.	Open the Dscan and the Probe Scanner. Find the white square on the right image. This window would be separated after clicking this square. Then click the pin on the right side of the square to fix it there. ![logo](https://notwojack.github.io/EVE-Exploration-Guide/image/7.6.3-3.png ':size=WIDTHxHEIGHT')
3.	Move the Selected Item to the place, where it is between the Analyzer’s minigame and the Lock Target List (on the image of suggested standard UI). This would make looting easier.

**Quick looting settings**

Open the Inventory, click the gear at the top left corner and tick the box on the right image (Always open in separate window), which don’t open your Inventory when you open a can. ![logo](https://notwojack.github.io/EVE-Exploration-Guide/image/7.6.3-4.png ':size=WIDTHxHEIGHT') <br>
Then move the window of the opened can to the place as same as on the right image, so that the button “Loot All” is on the “Open Cargo” button on the Selected Item UI. This enables you looting immediately after opening a can, and after looting, the window of the opened can would be closed automatically. ![logo](https://notwojack.github.io/EVE-Exploration-Guide/image/7.6.3-5.png ':size=WIDTHxHEIGHT')

### 7.6.4 Overview

By normal exploring, the overview in MOTD of the channel could be used, or use the overview provided by your corp. <br>
Read Uniwiki for setting the overview. <br>
Two kinds of settings are needed, the first one is the overview on the main UI, the second one is the bracket, which shows the target directly.

![logo](https://notwojack.github.io/EVE-Exploration-Guide/image/7.6.4-1.png ':size=WIDTHxHEIGHT')

Exploration overview: <br>
Suggested entities showed on the overview are the dockable upwell structures, stargates, stars, players’s ships, normal cans, hackable things in Sleeper Caches and Sentry Towers. <br>
Then set the brackets. Normally, showing all brackets is suggested. <br>
Optional: For exploring The Archive, you could make a special overview setting, which only shows the cans and Sentry Towers in Sleeper Caches, for locking targets in The Archive faster (The overview in MOTD of the channel includes it). With this, all cans could be locked easily with Ctrl+left click. Remember to switch to this setting before warping to The Archive.

### 7.6.5 The Ultimate Astero

Here is the introduction for the fit “The Ultimate Astero” in Chapter 8.4. Before using this fit, make sure that you have already trained Amarr Frigate and all main skills in Scanning, Armor, Shields and Engineering to IV or higher. Or you may have shortage of Capacitor or EHP. Then you could only use better Nano in Low slots. If your skill levels are high enough, you could fit with worse (but proper) equipments. <br>
The advantages of this fit are: <br>
First, you never need to refit with explosive armor hardener anymore. Second, you have two T2 Hyperspatial Velocity Optimizers. They improve greatly your Warp Speed (If you use the whole set of High-grade Ascendancy at the same time, you could even reach 12AU/s.). If you are not going to tank the shock waves in The Archive, you could change everything except the explosive armor hardener to T2. And the Damage Control, the Steel Plate and the Shield Extender in the cargo are also no longer necessary.

Ghost Sites: When the explosive armor hardener are activated, there should be 80% armor explosive resistance. You could tank the explosion from a can in an Improved Facility without damaging your structure. If you are going to explore a Superior Facility, preoverheat your explosive armor hardener after deactivating your Cloaking Device. When the time comes, press the proper shortcut and it could be activated.

Gas Sites in Lowsec: Repair while hacking. Warping out is unnecessary.

Gas Sites in Nullsec: as what is written in chapter Advanced

Limited and Standard Sleeper Cache: Just hack it. In Standard Cache you could hack the Tractor Beam while holding on the Sentry Towers.

Mine Room: Cycle the explosive armor hardener.

The Archive: Change the armor repairer and armor explosive hardener to Damage Control and Steel Plates. Change the Cap Recharger to Shield Extender. Make sure you have more than 12050 EHP.

备注：如果追求最极限，可以把那个甲插也换成超空间，把联邦钢板换成深渊的，需要720+甲和-0.2以上的PG即可，然后把货柜扫描换成盾扩，在A护卫V的技能下应该有12050以上的有效(有效可能得确认下?)

PS: All towers have a bug. When there is a hacked can (or a functional container) nearby and the towers have locked you, if you warp out of the site now and come back, all towers would keep firing only on that hacked can.
